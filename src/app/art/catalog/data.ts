        text: `
            I focused on creating an airy, atmospheric perspective to draw the viewer into
            the world of a mother duck finding a safe place and looking to protect her
            eggs. I based the duck on the taxidermy at the art studio where I worked,
            and composed the background/foreground from nature photography books. Through
            this, my aim is to highlight the gentle beauty of the natural world,
            encouraging others to pause and appreciate nature’s delicate balance.

            This acrylic painting captures the energy and movement of a duck moments
            before taking flight. It was a practice in acrylic techniques—exploring how
            light interacts with water and how form conveys motion. The rippling surface
            and reflections were challenging, but balancing realism with expressive
            brushwork helped me refine layering and texture for dynamic nature scenes.

        text: `
            The painting is a still life study that allowed me to explore the interaction 
            of light, shadow, and color. Using a copper/brass pitcher alongside ripe fruits, 
            I was particularly intrigued by the way the warm metallic tones reflected the 
            surrounding colors, including the red table. The variations in texture—smooth 
            metal, soft fruit skin, and the wooden surface—offered a challenge in capturing 
            realism through oil paint.

        text: `
            The right painting takes on a more elaborate and thematic approach, inspired 
            by the richness and mystery of a masquerade. I used deep reds, browns, and 
            golds to evoke a sense of opulence and drama. The intricate elements, including 
            the mandolin, ornate bottles, and Venetian mask, contribute to the narrative of 
            festivity and grandeur. This larger piece allowed me to focus on intricate details, 
            fabric textures, and the interplay of warm tones to enhance the luxurious feel of 
            the composition. This piece won Silver Key at Scholastic Art & Writing Competition.

        img: "/images/art/catalog/painting-full-5.png",
        text: `
            This oil painting is a composition centered on flamingos wading through a 
            serene, lily pad-filled pond, with distant mountains adding depth to the 
            scene. While the piece doesn't hold a specific narrative, it served as an 
            opportunity for me to practice painting organic elements, such as water 
            reflections, lush vegetation, and the delicate textures of the lily pads. 
            The vibrant pink of the flamingos contrasts beautifully against the cool 
            blues and greens of the water and foliage, creating a visually striking 
            composition. This piece was recognized with an Honorable Mention in the 
            Scholastic Art & Writing Competition.

        text: `
            This piece explores the theme of perception—how we see and how we are seen. 
            The focal point is a single eye framed within a surreal window, blending 
            realism with abstraction. The surrounding dark, textured background, inscribed 
            with fragmented phrases, represents the complexities of identity, self-awareness, 
            and external judgment. Through this work, I wanted to challenge the viewer to 
            consider what it means to truly "see"—whether it's understanding someone beyond 
            the surface or questioning the lens through which we perceive the world.

        text: `
            This painting was a study in texture and hyperrealism, inspired by ancient 
            relief sculptures. I focused on replicating the depth and weathered details 
            of stone carvings, paying close attention to the play of light and shadow 
            across the surface. The challenge was to capture the illusion of a three-dimensional 
            relief using paint, giving the piece a tactile quality. This study allowed me 
            to push my technical skills while exploring how historical art forms can be 
            reinterpreted through modern painting techniques.

            This oil painting is a structured study that progresses from skeletal 
            form to a fully rendered portrait of a young woman. Beginning with an 
            understanding of the skull and musculature through paper sketches. This 
            piece allowed me to refine my approach to classical portraiture, focusing 
            on anatomical accuracy and the nuances of human expression. The final 
            painting captures not just the likeness but also the depth and warmth of 
            the subject, marking a culmination of technical study and artistic interpretation.

        text: `
            This self-portrait reflects my experience as a Chinese American who grew 
            up in China and the ways in which propaganda shapes perception—both in 
            China and the U.S. The elements in the painting, such as the bald eagle, 
            hawk, and the snake wrapped around my shoulders, symbolize different 
            narratives of power, freedom, and control. The cheerful expression contrasts 
            with the loaded imagery, inviting viewers to question the role of media and 
            nationalism in shaping personal and collective identity. This piece is a 
            visual exploration of duality, influence, and the complexity of growing up 
            between two cultures.
