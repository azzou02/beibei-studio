                        iâ€™ve been actively involved in this subject since primary 
                        school (doodling) and started learning traditionally in 
                        high school (with oil paint). i will admit i still have a 
                        hard time understanding abstract and contemporary art. but 
                        i like to learn about them as they record history.
